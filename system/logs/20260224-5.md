The goal 'Directly extract and transcribe the audio from the video URL at src_1, returning structured JSON (CAP-AUD-001)' directly maps to CAP-AUD-001 (Media Transcription). This capability operates directly on the source URL (src_1) and does not require intermediate storage in Wasabi, aligning with application.md Section 11 (Storage Bypass). A single task (task_1) is created with no dependencies. Input ref is src_1, output ref is derived_1. derived_1 is registered as a 'JSON Transcript' produced by CAP-AUD-001. Task weight is 'medium' for transcription. Execution group 1 contains task_1. The user's '08:20' timestamp is noted but cannot be actioned by the current CAP-AUD-001, which performs full video transcription. parent_message_id constructed from Goal Agent's timestamp '2026-02-24T10:00:00+08:00'."

My first solo trip was about 4 years ago. Honestly, I was really nervous to travel solo again. Somewhere along the way, I just forgot how to be on my own. We're in Singapore! So I made a vision board for this trip. I want to live in the moment, do something out of my comfort zone, and gain new perspectives of Singapore. So when I heard about this tour, I knew I had to book it. It's a two-hour walking tour led by experts on the gangsters of Singapore, and the guides share real stories about crime, present regret, and rebuilding their lives. This is the perfect way to start solo traveling because you don't feel alone, you meet new friends, learn from a local, and ask strangers where they got some drinks because I am thirsty. I felt braver. The rest of the trip didn't feel scary anymore. So traveling isn't just about seeing new places. It's about being spontaneous and keeping an open mind when traveling. It's about seeing us through every adventure. It's also about meeting yourself again.\"\n    }\n]\n```",
