User request contains three distinct actions (download, transcribe, analyze sentiment) requiring separate objectives. Applied Acquisition-First Pattern: Objective 1 acquires from src_1 to store_1 with URL annotation. Objective 2 (transcription) is the first analysis objective, referencing store_1 with provenance (acquired from src_1). Objective 3 (sentiment analysis) is a subsequent analysis objective, referencing store_1 with a bare ref. Pre-Output Self-Check confirmed correct URL annotation, objective separation, and first-mention provenance."

These were deduplicated into single tasks (task_5, task_7, task_8, task_9, task_6 respectively) to avoid redundant execution. Derived ref registration: derived_1 (audio_track from store_1, CAP-PRE-002), derived_2 (frame_set from store_1, CAP-PRE-003), derived_3 (transcript from derived_1, CAP-AUD-001), derived_4 (diarization_map from derived_1, CAP-AUD-002). Dependencies were resolved based on application.md Section 6.9 Prerequisite Rules, ensuring correct sequencing (e.g., language detection before transcription). Tasks were grouped into 8 execution tiers, allowing for parallel processing where dependencies permit. Execution order is a valid topological sort. The final workflow consists of 15 unique tasks."
