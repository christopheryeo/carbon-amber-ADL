The 'Media Transcription' capability (CAP-AUD-001), as defined in context/application.md Section 6.2 and Section 11 ('Constraints and Boundaries'), explicitly states that transcription MUST operate directly on the source URL (src_N) and MUST NOT store or read anything from Wasabi file storage. Therefore, no 'store_N' ref was created, and the 'Acquisition-First Pattern' for storage was not applied to avoid violating the 'Storage Bypass' constraint. The objective directly references src_1 for transcription. Pre-output self-check passed: no acquisition objective, single strategic outcome, no store_N references."

As per application.md Section 6.9, CAP-AUD-001 operates directly on the source URL and outputs a JSON transcript. The 'Storage Bypass' constraint (application.md Section 11) is respected as no Wasabi storage is involved. No dependencies for this single task. Assigned to execution group 1. Estimated weight 'medium' for transcription. Derived ref 'derived_1' is registered with parent 'src_1', asset_type 'transcript', and capability 'CAP-AUD-001'. The parent_message_id was constructed deterministically from the Goal Agent's timestamp. Derived ref numbering is sequential. Deduplication log is empty as no goals were merged."
