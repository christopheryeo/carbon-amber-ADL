User request involves video acquisition, speaker identification, transcription, emotional state analysis, facial attribute analysis, and multi-modal relationship inference, requiring multiple objectives. Applied Acquisition-First Pattern: Objective 1 acquires from src_1 to store_1, including the URL annotation. Objective 2 is the first analysis objective, referencing store_1 with provenance (acquired from src_1) for speaker identification (CAP-AUD-002). Objectives 3, 4, 5, and 6 are subsequent analysis objectives referencing store_1 without provenance, covering transcription (CAP-AUD-001), speaker emotional state (CAP-AUD-003, CAP-SPK-001), facial attributes (CAP-VIS-006), and multi-modal relationship inference (CAP-SYN-001, CAP-SYN-003). Each objective represents a single strategic outcome, adhering to objective separation rules."

Derived refs (derived_1 through derived_9) were registered for intermediate assets (audio_track, frame_set, diarization_map, transcript, facial_attributes, emotion_scores, sentiment_scores, fused_insights for stance, fused_insights for synthesis) with their respective parent_ref_ids and capability_ids. Execution groups were assigned based on dependency tiers, allowing for parallel execution where possible. The execution_order is a valid topological sort. All pre-execution validation checks passed. The overall plan addresses identifying people and explaining relationships through a multi-modal analysis pipeline culminating in stance analysis and a fused report."

Objectives 3 and 4 focus on visual analysis (lighting, color, mood assessment) for each scene (CAP-VIS-005). Objective 5 is a comparative synthesis (CAP-SYN-001, CAP-SYN-003).

This includes audio extraction (CAP-PRE-002), language detection (CAP-AUD-004), transcription (CAP-AUD-001), diarization (CAP-AUD-002), frame extraction (CAP-PRE-003), scene segmentation (CAP-PRE-004), scene classification (CAP-VIS-005), action recognition (CAP-VIS-004), multi-modal fusion (CAP-SYN-001), and timeline reconstruction (CAP-SYN-002). Objective 3 (identify turning points) also decomposed into 10 goals, mirroring the comprehensive analysis steps of Objective 2, as it requires similar content understanding and event identification. The First-Mention Provenance Rule was applied for the first goal referencing store_1 in both Objective 2 and Objective 3. Language detection was explicitly included before transcription in both analysis objectives as per rule #11."

Applied Acquisition-First Pattern for objective 1. For objectives 2 and 3, a comprehensive multi-modal analysis pipeline was constructed, including audio extraction, language detection, transcription, speech emotion, frame extraction, video segmentation, scene classification, and action recognition. These analysis outputs feed into multi-modal fusion (CAP-SYN-001) and timeline reconstruction (CAP-SYN-002) to address the user's request for conflict start and turning points. Finally, a structured report (CAP-SYN-003) is generated. Derived ref registration: derived_1 (audio_track from store_1, CAP-PRE-002), derived_2 (frame_set from store_1, CAP-PRE-003), derived_3 (transcript from derived_1, CAP-AUD-001), derived_4 (scene_classification from derived_2, CAP-VIS-005), derived_5 (action_recognition from derived_2, CAP-VIS-004), derived_6 (emotion_scores from derived_1, CAP-AUD-003), derived_7 (fused_insights from multiple derived_refs, CAP-SYN-001), derived_8 (timeline from derived_7, CAP-SYN-002). DAG validation passed: no circular dependencies. Execution groups were assigned based on dependency tiers, allowing for parallel execution where possible. The execution order is a valid topological sort. The parent_message_id was deterministically constructed from the Goal Agent's timestamp."

Dependencies resolved based on application.md Section 6.9 Prerequisite Rules, ensuring correct sequencing (e.g., language detection before transcription, diarization before speech emotion and sentiment). Tasks grouped into 8 execution tiers to maximize parallelism. Execution order is a valid topological sort. All pre-execution validations passed. parent_message_id constructed deterministically from Goal Agent's timestamp."
