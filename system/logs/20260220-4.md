Platform detection: youtu.be domain maps to YouTube, which is supported (context/application.md, Section 6.1 and 7). The user request involves both video acquisition and multi-modal analysis. Applied Acquisition-First Pattern by creating an initial objective for video acquisition, including the URL annotation on src_1 for traceability. Subsequent analysis objectives reference store_1. The first analysis objective 'identify all distinct individuals' includes provenance 'acquired from src_1'. The request requires identifying people, analyzing body language (visual), transcribing dialogue (audio), and then inferring relationships (multi-modal fusion and reasoning). These break down into four distinct strategic analysis objectives."
