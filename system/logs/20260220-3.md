User request contains two distinct actions: video acquisition and temporal event analysis, necessitating separate objectives. Applied the Acquisition-First Pattern by creating Objective 1 for video acquisition (Obtain video content from src_1 (URL) and store as store_1). Objective 2 addresses the analysis requirement by referencing store_1 with provenance ('acquired from src_1') as per the First-Mention Provenance Rule, and asks to identify specific temporal events (conflict start, turning points). This maps to Scene Understanding and Timeline Reconstruction capabilities. No out-of-scope elements detected."
