Objective 2 is the first analysis objective, referencing store_1 (acquired from src_1) for speaker identification (CAP-AUD-002). Objective 3 is a subsequent analysis objective, referencing bare store_1 for emotional tone analysis (CAP-AUD-003).

Objective 2, 'From store_1... identify distinct speakers', was decomposed into 5 goals. This leverages capabilities for audio track extraction (applying First-Mention Provenance Rule for store_1), language detection, transcription, diarization (CAP-AUD-002), and speaker profiling (CAP-SPK-003). Objective 3, 'From store_1, analyze emotional tone of each identified speaker', was decomposed into 4 goals. Since audio extraction, language detection, transcription, and diarization are pre-conditions already addressed in Objective 2, Objective 3 focuses on the specific analysis tasks: vocal emotion recognition (CAP-AUD-003), sentiment analysis on transcripts (CAP-SPK-001), facial expression analysis from video frames (CAP-VIS-006), and correlating these multi-modal results (CAP-SPK-002, CAP-SYN-001).

Execution groups were assigned to reflect parallelization opportunities (e.g., task_3/task_4 and task_6/task_7). A topological sort determined the execution order. All workflow validations passed (completeness, DAG, dependency, execution order, group consistency, capability, ref consistency, derived ref registration).
