Objective 4 (Speaker Sentiment Analysis) was decomposed following Pattern C, including multi-modal aspects (vocal, text, visual facial expressions) and correlation. Redundant pre-condition goals (like audio extraction, transcription, speaker identification) are included in each objective's goal list for completeness, as per Goal Agent specification, to ensure the Planning Agent has all required dependencies explicitly stated and can handle deduplication and optimal sequencing."
