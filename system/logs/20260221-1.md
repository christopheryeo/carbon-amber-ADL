Objective 2 is the first analysis objective, referencing store_1 with provenance (acquired from src_1) for audio transcription. Objectives 3 and 4 are subsequent analysis objectives, referencing store_1 with bare ref IDs for speaker identification and sentiment analysis respectively.

This reduced the total tasks from 13 to 9. Dependencies were resolved based on Section 6.9 of application.md and Planning Agent rules (e.g., CAP-AUD-001 depends on CAP-AUD-004, which depends on CAP-PRE-002). Execution groups were assigned based on dependency tiers, allowing for parallel execution where possible (e.g., task_3/task_4 and task_7/task_8). Derived refs were registered for audio_track (derived_1), transcript (derived_2), and diarization_map (derived_3) as per the I/O Asset Types table. Workflow validation confirmed DAG validity, completeness, and ref consistency. The next agent is 'perception_agent' as it's the first executional agent for analysis tasks. parent_message_id was deterministically constructed from the Goal Agent's timestamp."

Applied Acquisition-First Pattern: Objective 1 acquires from src_1 to store_1, including URL annotation. Objective 2 references store_1 (acquired from src_1) for identifying conflict start, applying First-Mention Provenance Rule. Objective 3 references store_1 for identifying turning points, using bare ref ID as it's a subsequent mention. All objectives represent single strategic outcomes."

Objective 3 (identify turning points) decomposed into 5 goals, also leveraging CAP-PRE-003, CAP-PRE-004, CAP-VIS-005, and CAP-SYN-002. Shared pre-condition goals (frame extraction, scene segmentation) are explicitly included in both Objective 2 and 3 as per the 'Handling Shared Pre-Conditions' rule, ensuring complete coverage for each objective.
