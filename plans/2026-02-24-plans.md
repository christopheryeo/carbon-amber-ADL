## What Can Be Done Today

### 🔴 Priority 1: Action Agent Messaging Non-Compliance
The Action Agent executing in n8n does not conform to the ADL `message_format.md` specification.

#### 1.1 🆕 Standardize Action Agent JSON Output
- **Problem:** Log `20260224-1.md` reveals `action_agent` output is completely non-compliant. It lacks `message_id`, `next_agent`, `status`, `error`, `metadata`, `resources`, and `audit` blocks. It also places the payload inside `output.content.response_text` instead of formatting standard refs.
- **Action:** Update/verify `agent/executional/action.md` to aggressively enforce `message_format.md` structure. Note: If the agent logic in `action.md` is already correct, this indicates the n8n layer is using legacy prompts or intercepting/formatting the response incorrectly.
- **Effort:** ~30 mins

#### 1.2 🆕 Action Agent Capability Routing Fix
- **Problem:** The Action Agent successfully downloaded the video but hallucinated a response about being unable to fetch metadata. The Planning Agent correctly split the download (task 2) and metadata extraction (task 4), but the Action Agent (or n8n) seems to have attempted both at once using a generic tool and failed.
- **Action:** Review `action.md` to ensure it strictly executes *only* the single `task_id` passed by the Dispatch Agent. 
- **Effort:** ~15 mins

### 🟡 Priority 2: Cross-Reference Report Resolution
#### 2.1 🆕 Document Schema Loading (Finding C2)
- **Problem:** The cross-reference report flagged that `instructions.md` mentions `message_schema.json` but doesn't explain how or when it's loaded.
- **Action:** Update `instructions.md` to clarify that `message_schema.json` is used for validation during the development/testing phase, or explain its orchestration layer usage.
- **Effort:** ~10 mins

### 🟢 Priority 3: Learning Agent Design (Deferred)
#### 3.1 🆕 Design `learning.md`
- **Problem:** The Learning Agent is the final operational core agent not yet implemented.
- **Action:** Outline the responsibilities, triggers, and capabilities of the Learning Agent (e.g., updating user preferences, identifying workflow inefficiencies).
- **Effort:** ~45 mins
