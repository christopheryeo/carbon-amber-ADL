# Agent-Application Separation Phase 2 Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Reference:** `plans/2026-02-23-plans.md` — Priority 1 (Items 1.7–1.11)

This document tracks the progress and verification of Phase 2 of the Agent-Application Separation refactoring (tasks 1.7 through 1.11). The primary goal is to verify that these files are completely decoupled from the specific DSTA video-analysis application constraints before closing out Priority 1.

## 1.7 Refactor `goal.md` Patterns
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `agent/governance/goal.md`, `context/application.md`
**Objective:** Move deeply-coupled video-specific patterns (Patterns A–J) to the application context.
**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] Patterns A-J removed from `agent/governance/goal.md`
- [x] Placeholder added to `agent/governance/goal.md` pointing to `application.md`
- [x] Patterns A-J successfully migrated to `context/application.md` as "Goal Decomposition Patterns"

## 1.8 Refactor `action.md` Governance Path & Defaults
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `agent/executional/action.md`, `context/application.md`
**Objective:** Fix the broken governance file path parameter and remove default execution parameters (e.g. sample rates, output formats).
**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] Canonical governance path updated from `"agent/executional/execution.md"` to `"agent/executional/action.md"`
- [x] Hardcoded parameter defaults (e.g., wav, 16000Hz, 1.0s interval) removed from `action.md`
- [x] Default parameters documented in `context/application.md` instead

## 1.9 Refactor `objective.md` & `goal.md` Scope Validation
**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `agent/governance/objective.md`, `agent/governance/goal.md`
**Objective:** Generalise the scope validation lists by pointing them to `application.md` instead of hardcoding expected in-scope capabilities.
**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] `objective.md` scope validation replaced with generic verbiage referencing `application.md`
- [x] `objective.md` genericised "video content" language (e.g. replaced with "source content")
- [x] `goal.md` scope validation replaced with generic verbiage referencing `application.md`

## 1.10 Refactor `reasoning.md` Output Schemas
**Status:** 🆕 Not Started
**Files:** `agent/operational/reasoning.md`, `context/application.md`
**Objective:** Move the extremely detailed and application-specific CAP-SYN output schemas into the application context.
**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Detailed synthesis output schemas (for CAP-SYN-001, CAP-SYN-002, etc.) removed from `reasoning.md`
- [ ] `reasoning.md` restructured to instruct the agent to retrieve output schemas from `application.md`
- [ ] Schemas successfully migrated to `context/application.md`

## 1.11 Refactor `objective.md` Capability Mapping
**Status:** 🆕 Not Started
**Files:** `agent/governance/objective.md`
**Objective:** Replace the hardcoded capability mapping table in the Objective Agent with a reference to the equivalent section in the application context.
**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Hardcoded capability mapping table (e.g. audio analysis, visual analysis categories) removed from `objective.md`
- [ ] `objective.md` instructs the agent to consult `application.md` for capability categories and their identifiers
