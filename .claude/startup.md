# Morning Startup Process

## 1. Read Project Documentation
Read all Markdown files in `doc/` in order to get current on the Carbon Amber architecture before doing anything else:

1. `doc/carbon amber architecture.md` — overall system architecture and design
2. `doc/carbon-amber-ADL Agent Architecture Change Report.md` — recent architectural changes and agent evolution
3. `doc/dispatch-agent-how-it-works.md` — how the dispatch agent operates at runtime

> The `.docx` file in `doc/` cannot be read directly; skip it.

## 2. Sync Check
```
git fetch && git status
```
Confirm local branch is in sync with `origin/main`. If behind, pull first. If ahead, investigate before proceeding.

## 3. Orient to Yesterday's Work
- Read the most recent `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-plans.md` to recall what was planned
- Read the most recent `plans/YYYY-MM-DD Audit.md` to recall what was completed
- Note any deferred items or open questions carried forward

## 4. Check for New Log Files
Look for new runtime log files in `system/logs/` generated by the n8n orchestration layer since last session.

If new logs exist, for each log file:
1. **Read the log** in full
2. **Validate compliance** — check whether the agent behaviour recorded in the log faithfully reflects how the agents are defined in this project. Cross-reference against the relevant agent definition files (`agent/governance/`, `agent/operational/`, `agent/executional/`) and governance files (`context/governance/`). Use `.claude/log_validation.md` as the analysis format reference.
3. **Write an audit report** into today's `plans/YYYY-MM-DD Audit.md` under a dedicated section:

```
## Log File Audit: <log filename>

### Summary
<brief description of what the log contains>

### ✅ What's Working Well
<compliant behaviours observed>

### ⚠️ Issues Identified
<violations or deviations from agent definitions, with severity and root cause>

### Verdict
<overall compliance assessment>
```

- If none: skip to step 5

## 5. Create Today's Plan File and Audit Template
Create **both files together** — never one without the other.

**`plans/YYYY-MM-DD-plans.md`:**
- Use the most recent `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-plans.md` as the format reference (status legend, section structure, effort table, recommended execution order)
- Carry forward any incomplete or deferred items from yesterday
- Add new tasks identified from log analysis (if any)
- Group by priority (P1 highest → P4 lowest) with estimated effort per task

**`plans/YYYY-MM-DD Audit.md`:**
- Create as a shell with today's date header and a placeholder for each priority group
- Structure mirrors the plans file — one `## Priority N: <Name>` section per group, ready to receive `## N.N` task entries as work is completed
- Do not pre-populate task entries; those are written as tasks are done

## 6. Begin Work in Priority Order
Work through tasks top-to-bottom by priority. After completing each priority group:
- Write audit entries to `plans/YYYY-MM-DD Audit.md` (one `## N.N` block per task)
- Update task icons in `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-plans.md` (`🆕` → `✅`) and append `✅ Done` to the priority heading
- Commit: `git commit -m "Complete Priority N <name>"`
- Push to remote

## 7. End-of-Day Wrap-Up
- Run a final completion audit verifying all planned items are genuinely complete (grep-based, not trust-based)
- Append the audit report to `plans/YYYY-MM-DD Audit.md`
- Final commit and push
- Confirm `git status` is clean

---

## Key Preferences (Summary)
- **Audit and plans files are always updated together** — never one without the other
- **Commits per priority group**, not per individual task
- **Audit entries use the `## N.N Task Name` checklist format** — no summary bullet lists (see `CLAUDE.md` for full spec)
- **Log analysis follows the format in `plans/carbon-amber-adl Development.md`** Part 1
