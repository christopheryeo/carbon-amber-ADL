# Markdown File Format Governance Standard

## Purpose
This document establishes the required format and structure for all markdown files within the Agentic AI folder to ensure consistency, clarity, and maintainability across the organization.

## File Format Requirements

All markdown (`.md`) files in the Agentic AI folder must include:

### 1. Header Text
- **Requirement**: Every markdown file MUST begin with a main heading (H1) that clearly identifies the file's purpose
- **Format**: Use `#` for the main title
- **Example**: `# Project Roadmap`

### 2. Description
- **Requirement**: Every markdown file MUST include a description section immediately following the header
- **Location**: Place the description within the first section of the file, before any substantive content
- **Content**: The description should clearly explain:
  - What the file contains
  - Who should reference this document
  - When the document was last updated (optional but recommended)
  - Key topics or sections covered

### 3. Recommended Structure
```
