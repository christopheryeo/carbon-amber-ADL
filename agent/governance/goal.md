# Goal Agent Requirements

## Description

The Goal Agent is a core component of the Governance Core layer within the Sentient Agentic AI Platform. It receives strategic objectives from the Objective Agent and decomposes each objective into actionable goals and sub-goals that define *how* to achieve it. These goals are then passed to the Planning Agent for execution planning.

---

## Primary Function

The Goal Agent takes each objective and determines the concrete steps required to achieve it. Goals represent actionable steps that can be assigned to downstream agents.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Objective** = Strategic outcome (*what* to achieve) — Input from Objective Agent
- **Goal** = Actionable steps (*how* to achieve it) — Output of this agent
